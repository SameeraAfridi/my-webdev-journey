      <h2>My Web Development Journey: From University Struggles to GitHub Wins</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>📍 Introduction — Where It All Began</h3>
        <p>When I first stepped into university, I had heard of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, but I didn’t realize how deep web development could go. Soon, it felt like the tech world had raced ahead — AI, full-stack apps, cloud computing — and I was stuck at the starting line.</p>

        <h3>🎯 The YouTube Trap: My Early Struggles</h3>
        <p>Like many students, I began with YouTube tutorials — jumping between channels from India, the US, and beyond. I’d start an HTML course, stop halfway, start another, and stop again. This cycle went on for months.</p>
        <blockquote>📌 Lesson learned: Watching isn’t the same as doing. You have to build.</blockquote>

        <h3>⚡ Switching Gears — Building My First Projects</h3>
        <p>One day I decided to stop waiting for the “perfect time” and just <em>make</em> something. My first projects were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal portfolio</strong> — a page about me and my learning path.</li>
          <li><strong>University landing page</strong> — a one-page HTML/CSS site with a hero section, features, and contact area.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📚 Why HTML & CSS Are Still Worth Learning</h3>
        <p>In 2025, some call HTML/CSS “basic,” but every website is built on them. Knowing them well makes learning tools like React so much easier.</p>

        <h3>📈 The GitHub Boost — My New Daily Habit</h3>
        <p>Uploading projects to <strong>GitHub</strong> was a game-changer. It’s not just backup — it’s a public portfolio and daily motivation tool. Seeing my contribution graph light up pushes me to code every day.</p>
        <blockquote>💡 Tip: Commit regularly. Even small changes keep momentum and impress recruiters.</blockquote>

        <h3>🔮 Where I’m Headed Next</h3>
        <p>Next: <strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactivity, followed by backend work (PHP/MySQL or Node.js). My process is simple: learn → build → push to GitHub → share.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>🔥 Why You Should Start Your Own Journey</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t wait to “know enough” — start now.</li>
          <li>Tutorials help, but building projects teaches more.</li>
          <li>Tracking progress on GitHub is both proof and motivation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>💬 Final Words</h3>
        <p>Starting was the hardest part. Watching videos didn’t help until I built something and published it. If I can start during university, so can you. The best time to start was yesterday — the second best is today.</p>
