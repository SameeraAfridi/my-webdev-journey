 My Web Development Journey
Welcome to My Web Development Journey â€” a personal blog where I share my step-by-step progress in learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and backend development.
This repository powers my live blog hosted via GitHub Pages, where I document my skills, projects, and growth as a developer.

 About This Project
I started this blog to:

Track my learning progress publicly.

Build a portfolio of HTML/CSS/JS projects.

Inspire other beginners who are starting their web dev journey.

HTML & CSS â€“ Structure & styling of the web.

JavaScript â€“ Adding interactivity.

Backend Development â€“ PHP/MySQL or Node.js.

Full Stack Projects â€“ Combining frontend + backend.

Git & GitHub â€“ Version control mastery.

Deployment & Hosting â€“ Making projects live.

Continuous Learning â€“ Never stop exploring.
